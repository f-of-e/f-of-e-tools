Run `make` to build the program and `make install` to convert the program to the format needed by the Verilog design and copy it to the location needed for subsequent synthesis.

You will then need to change directory back to the `CUED-GB3-RISC-V-2019/verilog/hardware/processor/` directory and run `make` there to synthesize the design using the results from this directory and to program it to the FPGA.
